# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Expected projects:
##### Finish my Frametrap Generator (some data analysis with Street Fighter V's frame data)
##### Web Scraping some site (maybe: http://capcomprotour.com/standings/?lang=pt-br) or PUC PR Intranet
[Resource 1](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/)
[Resource 2](https://scrapy.org/)
[Resource 3](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/beginner-guide-web-scraping-beautiful-soup-python/)
##### Make a great responsive site with Javascript or something like that (I don't have any experience in frontend, I'd like to learning something)
##### Maybe resolve some problems set by [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/weeks)

===========================================
### Day 1: January 03, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Created the repository on github for the Frametrap Generator project; Fixed some issues with Vega's moves; Fixed the conditional to filter the moves that are or aren't a frametrap.

**Thoughts:** First day was fine. Maybe in the 2 or less days I will finish this project. But, I've to check all the html files to ascertain all the frametraps.
