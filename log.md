# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Expected projects:
##### Finish my Frametrap Generator (some data analysis with Street Fighter V's frame data)
##### Web Scraping some site (maybe: http://capcomprotour.com/standings/?lang=pt-br)
[Resource 1](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/)
[Resource 2](https://scrapy.org/)
[Resource 3](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/beginner-guide-web-scraping-beautiful-soup-python/)
##### Make a great responsive site with Javascript or something like that (I don't have any experience in frontend, I'd like to learning something)
##### Maybe resolve some problems set by [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/weeks)

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
