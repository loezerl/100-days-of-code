# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Expected projects:
##### Finish my Frametrap Generator (some data analysis with Street Fighter V's frame data)
##### Web Scraping some site (maybe: http://capcomprotour.com/standings/?lang=pt-br) or PUC PR Intranet
[Resource 1](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/)
[Resource 2](https://scrapy.org/)
[Resource 3](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/beginner-guide-web-scraping-beautiful-soup-python/)
##### Make a great responsive site with Javascript or something like that (I don't have any experience in frontend, I'd like to learning something)
##### Maybe resolve some problems set by [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/weeks)

===========================================
### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created the repository on github for the Frametrap Generator project; Fixed some issues with Vega's moves; Fixed the conditional to filter the moves that are or aren't a frametrap.

**Thoughts:** First day was fine. Maybe in the 2 or less days I will finish this project. But, I've to check all the html files to ascertain all the frametraps.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Generated framedata to with the FAT's json. V-trigger frametraps is already implemented and probably this project is done.

**Thoughts:** Today was more than 2 hours coding the script, and I'm happy that I've finished my first project. The next will be a web scraping using Python to!

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Learned some things using urllib and bs4 lib. Implemented a web scraping script on [this Page](http://rank.shoryuken.com/rankings/rank/SF5?alltime=true).

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to learning more things using bs4 to web scrap some pages. My final scrap will be on my University's Intranet WebPage. Thanks to [@macloo](https://twitter.com/macloo) for recommended the book: Web Scraping with Python that I will use to study!

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Learned how to use find, find_all and how to filter what I want in theses functions.

**Thoughts:** Not to much code, but reading and studying.

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Learned how to use next and previous siblings/parents and a few about the use of regex in web scraping.

**Thoughts:** Probably my study will continue until day 10. Then I'll start my web scraping project.

### Day 6: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Learned how to login into a page using the lib Requests.

**Thoughts:** I put the Python web scraping's book aside for now. Tried to learning something through searching!
